Examples
--------

In the following we will calculate a dispersion curve based on several
earthquakes recorded at two receivers (sta1, sta2) on the vertical 
components (Z). The seismograms (two per earthquake) are stored in as many directories 
as the number of earthquakes available in the analysis. These directories are named 
after the event origin time (in the obspy.UTCDateTime.timestamp format) and located
at /path/to/data. The seismic data must be in the .sac format, with the information on 
the epicentral distance (dist) compiled in the header. It is assumed that receivers 
and epicenter lie on the same great-circle path.

We will retrieve dispersion measurements for 75 periods linearly spaced
between 15 and 150s. We assume that in this period range surface waves travel
in the velocity range 2.5 - 5 km/s. We need to pass a reference curve
consisting of 2 columns (1st: period, 2nd: phase velocity in either km/s or
m/s), that will be used in the subsequent analysis. We will only employ 
periods for which the ratio between expected wavelength (based on the
reference curve) and inter-station distance is not smaller than 1.5.

First, we initialize the TwoStationMethod class as::

    tsm = TwoStationMethod(refcurve=refcurve,
                           periodmin=15,
                           periodmax=150,
                           no_periods=75,
                           cmin=2.5, 
                           cmax=5, 
                           min_no_wavelengths=1.5)
..

Then, we use this class obtain dispersion measurements for all events
available in the data directory. (We are assuming that we only have folders
corresponding to events that are aligned on the same great circle path as
the epicenter. For a more automatic processing of station pairs and events,
see the method `prepare_data` of :doc:`seislib.eq.EQVelocity <seislib.eq_velocity>`.) 
For each event, we will store the associated dispersion measurements in /path/to/savedir/dispersion, 
using the npy format::

    import os
    import numpy as np
    from obspy import read

    src = /path/to/data
    dispersion_dir = /path/to/savedir/dispersion
    
    events = os.listdir(src)
    for origin_time in events:
        st1 = read(os.path.join(src, origin_time, '%s*'%sta1))
        st2 = read(os.path.join(src, origin_time, '%s*'%sta2))
        
        tsm.preprocess(st1, st2, float(origin_time))
        dispersion = tsm.measure_dispersion()
        
        outfile = os.path.join(dispersion_dir, 
                                '%s_%s_%s.npy'%(sta1, sta2, origin_time))
        np.save(outfile, dispersion)
..
                
        
Now that all the dispersion measurements have been extracted, we can
calculate one dispersion curve based on them. (dist_km is inter-station 
distance in km). The result will displayed in the console (plotting=True)::
        
    dispcurve = tsm.extract_dispcurve(refcurve=refcurve,
                                      src=dispersion_dir,
                                      dist_km=dist_km,
                                      plotting=True,
                                      sta1=sta1,
                                      sta2=sta2)
..

.. _Parameters:

Parameters
----------


	**refcurve** (``(n, 2) ndarray``): Reference curve used to extract the dispersion curves. The first column should be period, the second column velocity (in either km/s or m/s). The reference curve is automatically converted to km/s, the physical unit employed in the subsequent analysis.

	**periodmin**, **periodmax** (``float``): Minimum and maximum period analysed by the algorithm (default are 15 and 150 s). The resulting dispersion curves will be limited to this period range

	**no_periods** (``int``): Number of periods between periodmin and periodmax (included) used in the subsequent analysis. The resulting periods will be equally spaced (linearly) from each other. Default is 75

	**cmin**, **cmax** (``float``): Estimated velocity range (in km/s) spanned by the dispersion curves (default values are 2.5 and 5). The resulting dispersion curves will be limited to this velocity range

	**ttol** (``float``): Tolerance, with respect to the reference curve, used to taper the seismograms around the expected arrival time of the surface wave (at a given period). In practice, at a given period, 
        everything outside of the time range given by tmin and tmax (see below) is set to zero through a taper. 
        tmin and tmax are defined as::
            tmin = dist / (ref_vel + ref_vel*ttol) 
            tmax = dist / (ref_vel - ref_vel*ttol)
        ..
        where dist is inter-station distance. Default is 0.3, i.e., 30% of the reference velocity

	**min_no_wavelengths** (``float``): Ratio between the estimated wavelength of the surface-wave at a given period (lambda = period * c_ref) and interstation distance. If lambda/dist > min_no_wavelength, the period in question is not used to retrieve a dispersion measurement. Values < 1 are suggested against. Default is 1.5

	**approach** (``str``): Passed to TwoStationMethod.measure_dispersion. It indicates if the dispersion measurements are extracted in the frequency domain ('freq') or in the time domain ('time'). Default is 'freq'

	**gamma_f** (``float`` | ``int``): Controls the width of the bandpass filters, at a given period, used to isolate the fundamental 
        mode in the seismogram. For technical details, refer to `Soomro et al., (2016)`_.

	**gamma_w**, **distances** (``(m,) ndarray``, optional): Control the width of tapers applied, at a given period, to the cross correlations in the frequency domain (these two parameters are ignored if `approach` is 'time'). `distances` should be in km. If not given, they will be automatically set to gamma_w = np.linspace(5, 50, 100) distances = np.linspace(100, 3000, 100) These two arrays are used as interpolators to calculate `gamma` based on the inter-station distance. `gamma` is the parameter that actually controls the width of the tapers, and is defined as gamma = np.interp(dist, distances, gamma_w)

Class Methods
-------------

.. py:method:: convert_to_kms(dispcurve)
Converts from m/s to km/s the dispersion curve (if necessary)

**Parameters**

	**dispcurve** (``(n, 2) ndarray``): The first column (typically frequency or period) is ignored. The second column should be velocity. 
        If the first value of velocity divided by 10 is greater than 1, the second column is divided by 1000. Otherwise, the dispersion curve is left unchanged.


**Returns**

    **dispcurve** (``(n, 2) ndarray``)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. py:method:: extract_dispcurve(refcurve, src, dist_km, prob_min=0.25, smoothing=0.3, min_derivative=-0.01, prior_sigma_10s=0.7, prior_sigma_200s=0.3, plotting=False, savefig=None, sta1=None, sta2=None)
Extraction of the dispersion curve from a given set of dispersion
measurements. These (one per earthquake) should be stored in a directory
in npy files.

The algorithm will (i) first gather all the dispersion measurments in a
unique ndarray of shape (n, 2), where the 1st column is period and
the 2nd is phase velocity. From this ensemble, (ii) it will then create 
a 2-D image representing the density of measurements, via a method 
similar to a kernel-density estimate (KDE). This image (of shape (k, l)
and henceforth referred to as 'P_obs'), is normalized at each period by 
the maximum at the same period. (iii) A second image, call it 'P_ref', 
is obtained from the reference curve: the weights given to each pixel at 
a given period are defined by a Gaussian function centred onto the
reference velocity at the same period, so that they decrease with 
distance from the reference velocity. As in P_obs, the image has a shape
of (k, l) and is normalized at each period by the maximum. (iv) Element-
wise multiplication of P_ref and P_obs yields a third image, call it 
'P_cond', which can be interpreted as the probability to measure a
dispersion curve at given period and velocity given the dispersion
observations and the a-priori knowledge of the reference curve. (v) The
dispersion curve is picked starting from the longest periods, where
the phase ambiguity is less pronounced, and is driven by two quality
parameters: `min_derivative` (so as to avoid velocity decreasing with
period) and `prob_min` (areas in P_cond characterized by values smaller
than `prob_min` are not considered).

**Parameters**

	**refcurve** (``(n, 2) ndarray``): Reference curve used to extract the dispersion curves. 
        The first column should be period, the second column velocity (in either km/s or m/s). 
        The reference curve is automatically converted to km/s, the physical unit employed in the subsequent analysis.

	**src** (``str``): Absolute path to the directory containing the dispersion measurements

	**dist_km** (``float``): Inter-station distance (in km)

	**prob_min** (``float``): "probability" in P_cond, at a given period, below which the dispersion curve is not picked. 
        Larger values are more restrictive. Good values are between ~0.2 and ~0.35. Default is 0.25

	**prior_sigma_10s**, **prior_sigma_200s** (``float``): Standard deviations of the Gaussians built around the reference model 
        (refcurve) at the periods of 10 and 200 s to calculate P_ref. At each analysed period, the standard 
        deviation is interpolated (and eventually linearly extrapolated) based on these two values. Smaller 
        values give more "weight" to the reference curve in the picking of the phase velocities. Defaults are 0.7 and 0.3

	**smoothing** (``float``): Final smoothing applied to the dispersion curve. The smoothing is performed using 
        `scipy.signal.savgol_filter <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.savgol_filter.html>`_. This parameters 
        allows for defining the window_length passed to the SciPy function, via::
            window_length = int(len(dispcurve) * smoothing)
        ..
        Default is 0.3

	**min_derivative** (``float``): Minimum derivative of phase-velocity as a function of period. If exceeded, 
        a quality selection will truncate the dispersion curve. To avoid the presence of gaps in the final dispersion curves, 
        if they are present due to this truncation, the branch of dispersion curve associated with the largest probability 
        (calculated from P_cond) is returned, the other(s) are discarded. Default is -0.01. Smaller values are less restrictive

	**plotting** (``bool``): If True, a figure is created for each retrieved dispersion curve

	**savefig** (``str``, optional): Absolute path to the output image. Ignored if `plotting` is False

	**sta1**, **sta2** (``str``, optional): Station codes of the two receivers used to calculate the dispersion curve. 
        If `plotting` is True, they are displayed in title of the title of the resulting figure. Otherwise they are ignored


**Returns**

    **dispcurve** (``(n, 2) ndarray``): Dispersion curve, where he 1st column is period and the 2nd is phase velocity in m/s
